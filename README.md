# jQuery Festival Timetable Plugin

This plugin creates an timetable for each day and stages of a festival. It also saves the selection in localStorage so it's still available to users after returning to the page.

Demo available at [malde.me/hurricane/](http://malde.me/hurricane/ "Hurricane 2013")

## jQuery Usage

Include the plugin somewhere in your page along with jQuery itself:

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="js/jquery.timetable.js"></script>

Use the plugin on a container of your choosing:

    $('#timetable').timetable({
        'firstHour': 11,        // the hour after which the performances are starting
        'lastHour': 2,          // the hour after the last performance of a day
        'file': 'festival.json' // the file containing the JSON data describing the festival (should be on the same domain)
    });

You might have to play around with the values to make the table fit into a page.

## Festival data

The data for the lineup follows the following format. A festival has an array of days, each day has an array of stages, which each have an array of artists playing those stages.
Each day and stage should be named. The data for an artist has 4 fields, an unique `id`, a `name` and the `time` (24h format) and `duration` (in minutes) of their performance.

    {
        "name": "Festival Name",
        "days": [
            {
                "name": "First Day",
                "date": "06/21/2013",
                "stages": [
                    {
                        "id": "blue",
                        "name": "Blue Stage",
                        "artists": [
                            {
                                "id": "national",
                                "name": "The National",
                                "time": "20:30",

                            },
                            {
                                "id": "portishead",
                                "name": "Portishead",
                                "time": "22:10",
                                "duration": 80
                            },
                            {
                                "id": "sigurros",
                                "name": "Sigur RÃ³s",
                                "time": "00:30",
                                "duration": 90
                            }
                        ]
                    },
                    {
                        "id": "2",
                        "name": "Stage 2",
                        "artists": [ ... ]
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Day 2",
                "date": "06/22/2013",
                "stages": [ ... ]
            }
        ]
    }

## Design / CSS

There are a few examples in the `/examples`-folder, but you should provide your own css (maybe use one of the examples as a starting point).

## Requirements

JSON in the Browser (so no legacy IE), basic HTML5 capabilities (eg. webStorage, so once again, no legacy IE).
jQuery somewhere in the page, should work with version 1.6 and upward, you should however use 2.0, since legacy IE will not work anyway.
